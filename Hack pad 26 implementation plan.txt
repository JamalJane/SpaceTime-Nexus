This Implementation Plan is designed as a linear "Construction Map." It is optimized for an AI Agent to execute, ensuring that high-performance dependencies (Three.js and SGP4 math) are integrated before the UI is layered on top.
________________


PHASE 1: The Foundation (Environment & Core Math)
Goal: Establish the TypeScript environment and ensure the orbital algorithms are accurate before building any visuals.
1. Project Initialization:
   * Initialize Vite with the React + TypeScript template.
   * Install core dependencies: three, @react-three/fiber, framer-motion, satellite.js, zustand, and gsap.
2. The Physics Worker:
   * Create a Web Worker for satellite.js. This prevents the SGP4 propagation math from locking the main UI thread.
   * Logic: Input: TLE (Two-Line Elements). Output: Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI) coordinates.
3. The Database Setup:
   * Execute the SQL Schema provided in the previous step to initialize PostgreSQL.
   * Seed the market_prices table with 2026 baseline scrap values.

PHASE 2: The Living Abyss (Background & 3D Engine)
Goal: Build the persistent animated background and the Earth model.
1. 3D Earth Rendering:
   * Load a high-resolution (4K) night-map texture onto a sphere with react-three-fiber.
   * Apply the "Exosphere Glow" shader using a MeshPhongMaterial with a thin Fresnel effect.
2. Antigravity Particle Simulation:
   * Instantiate 12,000 shards as a THREE.InstancedMesh.
   * Implement the Perlin Noise drift algorithm.
   * Add the Mouse Gravitation Hook: Use a Raycaster to track mouse position and apply a repelling force to the nearest particles.
3. SGP4 Viewport Integration:
   * Map the output of the Physics Worker to 3D space.
   * Render 10,000 points of debris as a point cloud surrounding the Earth.

PHASE 3: The Narrative Entry (ScrollReveal)
Goal: Create the cinematic landing sequence.
1. The Zero-UI State:
   * Style the landing container as bg-#050505 with overflow-hidden.
2. ScrollReveal Implementation:
   * Map the Dr. Hiluluk quote to a scroll-triggered timeline using framer-motion.
   * Animation Step: Apply the "Blur-to-Focus" transition on a per-character basis.
3. The "Shatter" Logic:
   * Trigger the state transition from "Narrative" to "Command" once the scroll reaches 100%.
   * Animate the 3D camera to zoom into the Earth as the text dissolves.

PHASE 4: The Command Interface (CardNav & Dashboard)
Goal: Build the interactive HUD and the secondary pages.
1. The HUD Framework:
   * Build the 32px margin master grid.
   * Implement the Top Header (Telemetry) and the Right Sidebar (Bounty Info).
2. The CardNav Component:
   * Build the horizontal pill navigation.
   * Apply the stroke-dasharray SVG border-draw animation for hover states.
   * Implement the Spring Expansion logic for "About," "Salvage," and "Terminal."
3. The Bounty Engine:
   * Build the Salvage Ops list view.
   * Integrate the NRV Equation (NRV=(Mass×Price)−(Fuel×Cost)) to calculate profitability in real-time.
________________


PHASE 5: The Technical Operations (Lambert & Star-Lock)
Goal: The high-detail interactive pages.
1. The Intercept Planner:
   * Create the "Time-of-Flight" slider.
   * Integrate the Lambert-Solver to draw the dashed transfer arc on the globe.
   * Implement the "Crawling Ants" animation on the path line using Three.js texture.offset.
2. Star-Lock Terminal (AI Logic):
   * Switch the 3D scene to the Star-Lock Viewfinder.
   * Load the TensorFlow.js model for constellation matching.
   * Calibration UI: Add the bracket-snapping animation when a star is detected.
3. The Tsiolkovsky Gate:
   * Write the logic that blocks the "Execute Burn" button if the Lambert Solver returns a Δv higher than the craft's current mass allows.
________________


PHASE 6: Mission Closure & Polishing
Goal: Cleanup and feedback loops.
1. The Recovery Ledger:
   * Design the high-contrast "Manifest Secured" popup.
   * Implement the database "Write" operation to log the successful salvage and update the user's profit history.
2. Performance Optimization:
   * Enable Frustum Culling for debris (don't render particles the camera can't see).
   * Compress the night-map textures into .webp for faster load times.
3. Final Polish:
   * Add the 1px HUD vibration effect on calculation completions.
   * Ensure all transitions (blur-out/fade-in) are consistent.
