The Database Schema (Relational)
This schema uses a Star-Lock logic where satellite metadata is static, but telemetry and market values are highly relational.
Table A: satellites (The Catalog)
Defines the permanent identity of every tracked object.
Column Name
	Data Type
	Constraints
	Description
	id
	UUID
	Primary Key
	Internal NEXUS unique identifier.
	norad_id
	Integer
	Unique, Indexed
	The official NORAD Catalog Number (e.g., 25544).
	name
	String
	Not Null
	Common name (e.g., "ZENIT-2 ROCKET BODY").
	object_type
	Enum
	DEBRIS, PAYLOAD
	Categorization for filtering.
	launch_date
	Timestamp
	-
	When the object entered orbit.
	dry_mass_kg
	Float
	-
	Estimated mass without fuel (used for NRV math).
	material_profile
	JSONB
	-
	Percentage breakdown (Aluminum: 70%, Gold: 2%).
	Table B: telemetry_logs (Orbital States)
Stores the SGP4-derived positions. This table is high-churn.

	tle_line1
	String
	-
	Raw TLE data for local SGP4 propagation.
	tle_line2
	String
	-
	Raw TLE data for local SGP4 propagation.
	altitude_km
	Float
	-
	Calculated altitude at epoch.
	decay_status
	Boolean
	-
	True if the object is expected to burn up < 30 days.

Real-time pricing for the salvage economy.

	Description
	id
	UUID
	Primary Key
	Mission ID.
	target_id
	UUID
	Foreign Key
	Link to satellites.id.
	status
	Enum
	PLOTTED, LOCKED
	Current mission state (Sequential flow).
	burn_delta_v
	Float
	-
	Calculated Δv from the Lambert Solver.
	profit_est
	Decimal
	-
	Calculated Net Resource Value (NRV).

2. Relationships & Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
* One-to-Many (satellites → telemetry_logs): A single satellite has thousands of telemetry points over time to track its decay.
* Many-to-Many (satellites ↔ market_prices): Indirectly linked via the Material Profile JSON. The backend joins the material percentages in the satellites table with the price_per_kg in the market_prices table to generate the live Bounty Value.
* One-to-One (missions → satellites): Each mission locks onto a single target until completion or failure.

3. API Dependencies & Limitations
API Source
	Purpose
	Frequency
	Limitations / Quotas
	Space-Track.org
	TLE Data
	1 Sync/Day
	Strict Limit: Max 20 requests per minute. Batch downloads required.
	CelesTrak GP
	Orbital Data
	1 Sync/Day
	No rate limit, but prefers JSON over CSV for Alpha-5 IDs.
	Metals-API
	Market Pricing
	1 Sync/Hour
	100 requests/day (Free Tier). We cache values in market_prices.
	NASA Stars API
	Navigation
	1 Sync/Lifetime
	Heavy payload; data is downloaded once and stored in a JSON blob.

4. Backend Logic Flow (The "Cron" Jobs)
1. TLE Sync (02:00 UTC): The backend polls Space-Track for all satellites. It filters for objects >100kg (salvageable mass) and updates the telemetry_logs.
2. NRV Recalculation (Every Hour): The system takes the market_prices, multiplies them by the material_profile of every satellite, and updates a Redis Cache for the frontend to show "Live Bounties" without hitting the main DB.
3. Propagation Buffer: To keep the website animated at 60FPS, the backend doesn't send every position. It sends the TLE Lines, and the frontend's Worker Thread runs the SGP4 math locally.
