The Color System (Hex Codes)
Element
	Hex Code

	Slightly lifted black for UI cards to create depth.
	Signal White (Text)
	#F2F2F2
	Off-white to reduce eye strain against the pure black.
	Bounty Gold (Highlight)
	#FFD700
	Used for "High-Value" targets and profitable mission markers.
	System Green (Safety)
	#00FF41
	"Matrix" green for successful locks and "Go" fuel status.
	Hazard Red (Warning)
	#FF3131

2. Atmospheric Background & Motion
The background is not a static image; it is a live, reactive particle system.
The Antigravity Background
* Visuals: A field of 10,000+ geometric fragments (triangles, shards, and dust).
* Behavior: The fragments do not float randomly. They are grouped into "Orbital Shells" (concentric rings).
* Interaction: When the user selects a page in the CardNav, the particles react.
   * About Page: Particles slow down to a 0.1x velocity, creating a calm, reflective state.
   * Terminal Page: Particles accelerate and align into linear "streaks," simulating high-speed travel or data processing.
* Physics: Fragments exhibit "Antigravity"—they move away from the user's cursor but gravitate toward the center of the Earth 3D model.
The ScrollReveal Narrative
* Animation: Text does not just fade in; it "materializes."
* Blur Logic: Each word starts at a blur(10px) and an opacity of 0. As the user scrolls, the blur reduces to 0px and opacity hits 1.
* The "One Piece" Quote: Centered in the middle of the viewport. No other UI elements are visible during this phase. This is a "Zen Mode" entry.
________________


3. Layout & Spacing (The HUD Architecture)
NEXUS uses a "Framed Viewport" layout. The center is always for 3D visuals; the periphery is for command data.
The Master Grid
* Outer Margin: 24px padding around the entire viewport to create a "Goggles" or "Helmet" feel.
* The Header (Top Left): * Displays the NEXUS Syndicate Logo (Vector White).
   * Telemetry: Current UTC time and "Orbital Density" percentage.
* The Target Sidebar (Right Side):
   * Width: 380px.
   * Style: Border-left: 1px solid #404040. Semi-transparent #0D0D0D background (glassmorphism with 10% blur).
   * Content: This is where the Bounty Engine data lives. High-contrast typography for the USD values.
The Navigation Hub (Bottom Center)
* Component: CardNav.
* Layout: A horizontal "Pill" container.
* Spacing: Each navigation item has a 12px gap.
* The Expansion: When a card is clicked, it expands upward using power3.out easing. The expanded card should never exceed 60% of the screen height, ensuring the Earth is always visible behind it.

4. UI Component Aesthetics
Hero bar for the hero bar use the video file. 
Typography
* Primary Header: "Inter" (Bold, Uppercase) - Letter spacing: 2px.
* Mono Data: "JetBrains Mono" - Used for all coordinates, hex values, and mathematical outputs (Lambert/Tsiolkovsky results).
Buttons & Interactive States
* The "Execute" Button: * Normal: Black background, 1px solid White border.
   * Active (Locked): Pulsing Gold shadow (box-shadow: 0 0 15px #FFD700).
   * Hover: Invert colors (White background, Black text).
* The Viewfinder (Star-Lock):
   * A perfect circle in the center of the screen with a 2px thin green crosshair.
   * Corners of the screen feature "Brackets" [ ] that flicker when the AI is scanning.

5. Page-Specific Guidelines
The Marketplace (Salvage Ops)
* List View: Minimalist rows. Each row height: 64px.
* Visual Cue: Targets are color-coded. A "Zenit Rocket" might have a Gold border, while a small bolt has a Gray border.
The Terminal (Intercept Planner)
* The Slider: A custom #F2F2F2 track with a #FFD700 thumb.
* The Path: The Lambert arc on the map should be a dashed line. As the user moves the slider, the dashes animate (crawling ants effect) to show the direction of travel.
The Star-Lock Terminal
* Background: The Earth is hidden. The background is a "Star Field" with a dark gray noise filter to simulate sensor grain.
* AI Feedback: As stars enter the viewfinder, small text labels appear next to them: SCANNING..., MATCH_FOUND, AZIMUTH_LOCKED.

6. Frontend Animation Principles
1. Staggered Entry: Elements should never appear at once. Use a 0.05s stagger between list items.
2. No Rigid Cuts: Every page transition must use a "Blur-out/Fade-in" or a "Slide-over" to maintain the feeling of a continuous software suite.
3. Haptic Visuals: When a mathematical calculation is completed (e.g., Lambert Solver finishes), the HUD should give a subtle 1px "shake" to simulate the computer processing the heavy data.
Core Animation Philosophy
Every movement in NEXUS follows the "Physicality of Data" rule:
* Weight: Elements move with slight inertia.
* Energy: Light (glows, flickers) has a high-frequency jitter to simulate electrical power.
* Depth: The 3D world (Three.js) and 2D UI (React) must be linked. If you rotate the Earth, the UI telemetry text should slightly "vibrate" to match the movement.

2. Global Motion Framework
A. The Antigravity Background (Three.js + Framer Motion)
This is the "soul" of the website. It isn't just a video background; it’s a live particle simulation.
* The Particles: 12,000 shards of #F2F2F2 (Signal White) floating in a #050505 (Obsidian) void.
* Idle State: Particles drift at a speed of 0.02units/frame, rotating slowly on their Y-axis.
* Interactive State: Using a custom hook, the particles follow the mouse cursor with a 1.5s lag, creating a "wake" behind the user's movements.
* Page Transitions: When switching modules (e.g., from Home to Terminal), the particles perform a Radial Explosion:
   1. All particles retract toward the Earth's center for 300ms.
   2. They blast outward toward the camera, blurring into white streaks (blur-md).
   3. They settle into the new page's layout configuration.
B. ScrollReveal: The Cinematic Entry
* Text Animation: Each character of the Dr. Hiluluk quote is wrapped in a <motion.span>.
* Entrance: As the user scrolls, letters don't just fade; they "Focus." They start at scale: 1.5, filter: blur(20px), and opacity: 0. They settle into place at scale: 1, filter: blur(0px), and opacity: 1.
* The Exit: Once the scroll hits the threshold, the entire quote undergoes a Chromatic Aberration effect (splitting into Red/Green/Blue channels) and dissolves into the 3D map.

3. UI Component Motion Details
The CardNav (Bottom Hub)
* The "Hover" Reveal: When hovering over a card, it doesn't just grow. The Bounty Gold (#FFD700) border "draws" itself around the card's perimeter using an SVG path animation (stroke-dashoffset).
* The "Active" Expand: Clicking
