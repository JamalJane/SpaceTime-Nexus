PRD: NEXUS (Network for EX-orbital Utilization & Salvage)
1. Project Overview
NEXUS is an orbital command-and-control platform designed to transform space debris from a "forgotten" liability into a high-value resource. The platform treats Earth's orbit as a graveyard of "pre-positioned" raw materials, providing the infrastructure to identify, value, and simulate the recovery of defunct satellites and rocket bodies.
The Philosophy: “A satellite only truly dies when it is forgotten.” NEXUS is the interface that remembers, enabling a sustainable circular economy in the cosmos.

2. Project Scope
In-Scope (Comprehensive Build)
* Real-Time Orbital Propagation Engine: A backend/frontend system utilizing the SGP4 algorithm to simulate the current position of 10,000+ objects, accounting for Earth's non-spherical shape and atmospheric interference.
* The Bounty Dashboard: A financial interface that maps metadata (NORAD IDs) to material estimates, providing a real-time marketplace for space scrap values.
* Celestial Navigation AI (Star-Lock): A computer-vision simulation requiring users to calibrate craft orientation by identifying star patterns through a virtual viewfinder.
* Maneuver & Intercept Planner: A tool to plot orbital transfers between a scavenger craft and target debris, including time-of-flight and fuel cost analysis.
* Atmospheric Decay Tracker: A system that monitors the "Perigee" of objects, flagging those with imminent reentry risks for "Priority Salvage."
* Integrated React UI Suite: Implementation of CardNav (System Management), Antigravity (Dynamic Debris Particles), and ScrollReveal (Narrative Entry).
* Market Price Integration: Real-time indexing of Aluminum, Titanium, and Gold scrap values to feed the Bounty Engine.
Out-of-Scope (Constraints)
* Hardware Kinematics: No coding of robotic arm joint torques, end-effector grasping logic, or "harpoon" deployment physics.
* Atmospheric Flight: No simulation of the initial launch phase (Earth-to-Orbit) or aerodynamic flight.
* Debris Capture Physics: No modeling of the physical collision or "soft docking" dynamics between two moving masses.
* International Legal Management: No logic for handling "Space Law" treaties, ownership disputes, or UN liability registrations.
* Live Satellite Imaging: No integration of actual live optical or radar feeds from Earth-based stations; all visual data is simulated via mathematical models.
* Active Debris Removal (ADR) Execution: NEXUS is a command and planning platform; it does not provide the actual telemetry link to physical de-orbiting hardware.

3. The Mathematics of the Void (Algorithms & Equations)
NEXUS relies on these five pillars of orbital mechanics and economics. Every equation below is a required functional component.
I. SGP4 Propagation (Positioning)
To find a "forgotten" object, we must account for the Earth's equatorial bulge (J2​ perturbation).
n=n0​[1+23​J2​p2RE2​​(1−23​sin2i)1−e2​]
Where:
* n0​: Mean motion.
* J2​: Second dynamic form factor (1.0826×10−3).
* RE​: Earth's equatorial radius.
* p: Semi-parameter a(1−e2).
II. Lambert’s Theorem (The Intercept)
Calculating the elliptical path between the scavenger and the debris over a specific time (Δt).
Δt=μa3​​[(ψ−sinψ)−(η−sinη)]
This determines the semi-major axis (a) of the transfer orbit, allowing NEXUS to calculate the required velocity vectors.
III. Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation (The Fuel Budget)
Determines if a mission is physically possible given the craft's current mass and fuel.
Δv=Isp​⋅g0​⋅ln(mfinal​minitial​​)
* Isp​: Specific impulse (engine efficiency).
* g0​: Standard gravity (9.80665m/s2).
* Δv: The total change in velocity required for the maneuver.
IV. Net Resource Value (The Bounty Formula)
The core economic logic that determines the profit of a salvage mission.
NRV=(i=1∑n​(Mi​⋅Pi​))−(Δv⋅Cfuel​)−(Ocost​⋅T)
Where:
* Mi​: Estimated mass of material (Aluminum, Titanium, etc.).
* Pi​: Market Price per kg of material.
* Cfuel​: Cost per unit of velocity change.
* Ocost​⋅T: The overhead cost over the duration of the mission.
V. Celestial Orientation (The Star-Lock Quaternions)
To navigate without GPS, the AI identifies star triangles to solve for the craft's attitude.
cosθ=∥A∥∥B∥A⋅B​
The AI then converts these angles into a orientation quaternion q to align the 3D HUD:
q=cos(θ/2)+(ux​i+uy​j+uz​k)sin(θ/2)

4. Success Criteria
* Telemetry Accuracy: Propagation error must remain <1% over a 24-hour simulation window.
* AI Robustness: Star-Lock must achieve a coordinate match with >90% confidence even with simulated sensor noise.
* UX Performance: Dashboard must render the Earth and 10,000+ points of interest at a stable 60FPS.
* Logic Integrity: The Bounty Engine must prevent "Mission Start" if the Δv required exceeds the calculated fuel capacity.
